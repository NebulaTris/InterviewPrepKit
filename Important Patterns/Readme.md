# Important Patterns
Learn the underlying patterns behind common coding interview questions. It provides a strategic approach to interview prep, focusing on essential patterns and techniques to solve problems efficiently, making it easier to navigate the vast number of potential questions.

Here are the 16 key patterns for acing coding interviews:

### Patterns 

1. **Sliding Window**: Used for finding a window of elements that satisfy some condition.
2. **Two Pointers**: Useful for problems that deal with sorted arrays or linked lists.
3. **Fast and Slow Pointers**: Helps solve problems that involve a cycle in a linked list or array.
4. **Merge Intervals**: Used for problems that deal with overlapping intervals.
5. **Cyclic Sort**: Helps solve problems involving arrays containing numbers in a given range.
6. **In-place Reversal of a Linked List**: Used for reversing a linked list in-place.
7. **Tree Breadth-First Search**: Helps solve problems that require traversing a tree level by level.
8. **Tree Depth-First Search**: Used for solving problems that require traversing a tree node-by-node.
9. **Two Heaps**: Helps solve problems that require maintaining a balance between two heaps.
10. **Subsets**: Used for solving problems that involve finding all possible subsets of a set.
11. **Modified Binary Search**: Helps solve problems that involve searching in a rotated sorted array.
12. **Bitwise XOR**: Used for solving problems that involve bit manipulation.
13. **Top 'K' Elements**: Helps solve problems that involve finding the top K elements from a given set.
14. **K-way Merge**: Used for solving problems that involve merging K sorted lists.
15. **0/1 Knapsack**: Helps solve problems that involve optimizing the use of a finite resource.
16. **Topological Sort**: Used for solving problems that involve directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).

By mastering these patterns, you'll be able to recognize and solve a wide variety of coding interview questions efficiently.
